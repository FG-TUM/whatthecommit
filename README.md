FAQ
---

**Is it useful?** Yeah, sure, I mean it's perfect for those cases where you haven't committed a
change in ages and feel too important to use `git add -i`, so `git commit -am "$(whatthecommit)"`
to the rescue ;)

**How do I install it?** To get up and running as fast as possbile run

    curl -L http://github.com/lwe/whatthecommit/raw/master/whatthecommit > /usr/local/bin/whatthecommit && chmod 0755 !#:3

**Are there any options?** Sure, check `whatthecommit -h` for usage and options.
