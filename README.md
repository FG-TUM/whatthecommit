change for ages and are too tired to use `git add -i`, so just do `git ci -am "$(whatthecommit)"` ;)

    curl http://github.com/lwe/whatthecommit/raw/master/whatthecommit > /usr/local/bin/whatthecommit && chmod 0755 !#:3

*Are there any options?* Sure, check `whatthecommit -h` for usage and options.
