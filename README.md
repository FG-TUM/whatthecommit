whatthecommit
=============

Command line utility to fetch a neat and very useful commit message from http://whatthecommit.com :)

See `whatthecommit -h` for usage options, but basically all to get up and running is:

1. drop into your `$PATH`
2. run `whatthecommit` or even better try: `git commit -am $(whatthecommit)` ;)
